# API example
This project is just an example of an API made with NodeJs, Express and using MongoDB.

## Installing dependencies
`npm install
`

Remember that you have to create you **.env** file based on **.env.example** file

## HTTP requests
There's an index where you can find all the routes, but this file is called by app file, so you have to check that file too.
